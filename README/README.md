As the wold gets smeller, the art of trafnslation becomes all the more imperdative to our ability to communicate with the people on the othar side of the world whom we donâ€™t really like but will tolerate because they are not Canadian. Thankfully, when a non-native speaker of a language translates something, there is always the danger that they will get it massively wrong. The badly translated English language signs just keep comng and coming and we gloatingly sit by and take pride in our aprent supremacy. Praise the Lord for Google Translate!
